# MR-SP3SM
Smart Panel with 3 toggle switches, Analog MUX output for EMU or/and 3 Open-Drain outputs as regular switches.
Each switch has its own status LED with integrated backlight. Also there are 2 Fault/Error (or any other purpose) LEDs which are active-low. Switch status LEDs will illuminate slightly when backlight is activated, and will glow bright when switch is activated.
12V input is intended as backlight source, this can be either Clearance lights or any other 12V power source that is activated in dim lightning conditions. Can also be any other reasonable voltage, but series resistors then should be changed accordingly.
Switch active position can be changed by either soldering 0R resistors in other configuration, or by soldering switch itself upside down (mind that key hole, must also be replaced). Default active position is with lever up.
Here all design resources to make your own EMU MUX switch panel.
